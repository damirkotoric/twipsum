    <p>Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer." Then acts so indignant. Manufacturing openings, hires rise to highest levels of the recovery. It was an honor to welcome the Teachers of the Year to the WH last month. Today, we honor and thank all teachers!</p>
    <p>Biggest story today between Clapper &amp; Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!</p>
    <p>Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. Honored to welcome Georgia Prime Minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili to the @WhiteHouse today with @VP Mike Pence.</p>
    <p>Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel.</p>
